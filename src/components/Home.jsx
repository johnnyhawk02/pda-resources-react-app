      <h2>What is PDA?</h2>
      <p>
        Pathological Demand Avoidance (PDA) is widely understood to be a profile on the autism spectrum. 
        It involves the avoidance of everyday demands and expectations to an extreme extent, often driven by high anxiety levels and a need for control. 
        Individuals with a PDA profile may require different support strategies compared to other autistic individuals.

        This website provides a collection of resources for families, individuals, and professionals seeking information and support related to PDA and other SEND needs, particularly within the Merseyside area and the wider UK.
